overview of the program

Class Definition: The grade_tracker class helps manage and calculate grades for multiple subjects.

Input Grades: The grade_info method asks the user for the number of subjects and then collects the subject names and grades, storing them in a dictionary. It also keeps a list of the grades.

Calculate Average: The avg_grade method computes the average of the grades provided.

Determine Letter Grade: The overall_grade method converts the average grade into a letter grade based on predefined ranges.

Calculate GPA: The gpa method assigns a GPA value corresponding to the average grade.

Execution Block: If the script is run directly (not imported), an instance of grade_tracker is created.

Grade Processing: The script gathers grades, calculates the average, determines the letter grade, and computes the GPA using the methods defined in the class.

Output Results: Finally, the script prints the average grade, letter grade, and GPA.

Note: The code has a minor error in the if __name__ == '__main__': line (it should be __name__ instead of _name).
